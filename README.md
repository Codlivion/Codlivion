### Codlivion Here!

I am a self learning Indie Game Developer. I do everything from coding and game designing to graphics and music by myself. My current project is a 16 bit style 2D Platformer Game on Unity.
I am also learning different fields of coding. Using .NET Framework, I'm at Windows Forms level right now and on my way to ASP.NET.
Currently I can write in C#, but I plan to learn C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and maybe even Python thoroughly in time as well.

I am open to simple freelance works for beginners.

Some Desktop Application projects I am passively working on at the moment:
A TodoList Application
A Phonebook Application
A Finance Tracker Application
