### Codlivion Here!

An ambitious Indie Game Developer.
I work solo on my own retro style 2D projects where I do all the coding, game design, graphics and sound by myself.
Mainly using C#, have experimented some with Unity, and currently using MonoGame. I enjoy practicing C++ as well.
I also work on other fields of coding. I'm quite interested in desktop applications and did some small experimental projects in Windows Forms.
For Web Development, I'm still learning and building my knowledge on ASP.NET, Cloud, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I will be updating this as I improve.
